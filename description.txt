solution;
  sir, this is wat we learnt from this assignment:

Router architecture is designed so that routers are equipped to perform two main functions;
     process routable protcols and use routing protocols to determain best path.

Input port;
                       An input port performs several key functions.It performs the physical layer function of terminating an incoming physical link at a router.
                        An input port also performs link layer functions needed to interoperate with the incoming link.

Switching fabric;
                                The switching fabric connects the routers input ports to its output ports .this switching fabric is completely contained within the router network
inside of a network router.


Output Ports :
                          An output port stores packets received from the switching fabric and transmits these packets on the outgoing link by performing the necessary link-layer 
 and physical-layer functions.  
When a link is bidirectional (that is, carries traffic in both directions), an output port will typically be paired with the input port for that link on the same line card 
 (a printed circuit board containing one or more input ports, which is connected to the switching fabric).



Rotating Processor : The routing processor executes the routing protocols, maintains routing tables and attached link state information, and
 computes for forwarding table for the router. It also performs the network management functions.

 

Difficulties
we have learnt about the UDP Socket Programming and how to implement it.
but we couldnt implement transist time successfully.
